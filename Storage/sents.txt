paris lrb cnn rrb a traumatic event such as the num attacks or the assault on charlie hebdo in paris two weeks ago can produce huge shifts in public opinion
a surge in patriotism perhaps higher church attendances but one would not expect it to boost the work of an numth century writer
in france and especially in paris the mood over the past two weeks has been subdued but punctured by public displays of solidarity across faiths
in a famously fractious society there is a sense of cohesion
the french seemed to have coalesced in reaching back into their history and the enlightenment they have started reading voltaire
one of france s most renowned philosophers voltaire published his treatise on tolerance in num
it was an appeal for religious tolerance within and between faiths
the french publisher folio says sales of the treatise have increased significantly since the charlie hebdo attacks
between num and the beginning of this year folio had sold num copies of the book roughly num a year
from january num to num immediately after the rally in paris in support of free speech and tolerance some num copies were sold
folio said another num new copies would be made available to cope with demand
online orders on amazon and kindle have also spiked
when first published the treatise was a revolutionary creed and one that landed voltaire in trouble with the french government and especially powerful religious interests such as the jesuits
his message has endured to become a cornerstone of the french republic where the state and religion are formally and forcefully separated
but voltaire went far beyond the rifts within christianity in the treatise
i say that we should regard all men as our brothers he wrote
what the turk my brother the chinaman my brother the jew the siam yes without doubt are we not all children of the same father and creatures of the same god voltaire wrote the treatise because he was outraged by the execution of a protestant man jean calas who was wrongly convicted of murdering his own son to prevent him from converting to catholicism
his campaign to clear jean calas went all the way to king louis xv who pardoned calas posthumously
paris mayor we will sue fox news last week the justice minister here socialist christiane taubira celebrated voltaire s legacy when speaking at the memorial for the charlie hebdo cartoonist tignous
we can draw anything including a prophet because in france the france of voltaire and irreverence we have the right to make fun of religions she said
a right
yes because a right is democracy and democracy is the realm of the law
that sentiment was shared across the political spectrum
writing in le figaro on tuesday former prime minister dominique villepin said that faced with the drama that struck it france has shown great dignity
villepin from the conservative ump wrote that the people have chosen by instinct loyalty to france
it was fitting and perhaps not accidental that when world leaders gathered at the rally last week to commemorate those killed in paris they began their walk down the boulevard voltaire toward the place de la nation
scattered around them among the many tributes posters of the writer bordered with the motto je suis charlie
some of the marchers waved copies of a treatise on tolerance as they walked and left them at impromptu memorials in the place de la republique
the chateau at versailles once the residence of royalty devoted the hall of the pope to a portrait of voltaire in honor of the victims of the terror attack
underneath a sign quotes from the treatise what is tolerance it is the prerogative of humanity
opinion attacks show hypocrisy of west s outrage the societe voltaire charged with keeping the philosopher s flame alive says the attacks in paris were also an attempt to assassinate him
in an article in lexpress the societe said voltaire s lifelong struggle was to crush the infamous lrb a saying with which he often ended his letters rrb and defend the victims of fanaticism
in the words of the societe s alain sager the border today is not between the religious and the atheist between the christian and nonchristian muslim and nonmuslim between the jewish and nonjewish
it is between barbarism and civilization
among the millions of tweets in the wake of the charlie hebdo killings not a few cited these words attributed to voltaire i do not agree with what you have to say but i will defend to the death your right to say it
voltaire never actually said that
the phrase was invented by his english biographer many years later
but he did write this in a treatise on tolerance the fewer dogmas the fewer disputes the fewer disputes the fewer miseries if this is not true then i m wrong
twohundredfifty years later the words have new resonance
why play one sport when you can play two at the same time that was the question a number of likeminded individuals were asking themselves circa num
and it is thanks to the vision of these select few that the sport of footgolf a game unsurprisingly combining elements of football and golf was born and has been spreading its way around the globe ever since
one of those men was mike oconnor who today combines the roles of president of the federation for international footgolf lrb fifg rrb and president of uk footgolf
i just knew footgolf would be a bit of a nobrainer for the amount of golf courses there are as well as the number of golfers and footballers oconnor told cnn of a game that involves players kicking a football around a golf course complete with bigger holes
i always thought it would take off
so it was just a question of waiting for the right time to get involved with it all really
after years in production oconnor would bring the sport to the uk where there are now over num active players and set up uk footgolf in num
yet it is a dutchman called michael jansen who is credited with the title of founding father of the game
he created what we do today oconnor said
he created everything from how the game is played down to the look of the players
kicking around a new idea jansen now an fifg ambassador held the first footgolf competition in the netherlands in num after hearing of a unique idea from friend and former professional footballer willem korsten
korsten had played an early interpretation of the game during his days at tottenham hotspur when he and his teammates would attempt to kick a football from the training pitch back to the changing rooms in as little time as possible
the mere invention of footgolf seems to be a natural progression given that football and golf have long shared a close relationship
footballers are well known for playing golf in their spare time so perhaps it is no surprise that footgolf has proved such a hit with those hailing from a footballing background num of people who have taken up the sport have been footballers
while there is obviously the relaxing aspect of walking around a golf course on a sunny day former english premier league player bryan hughes also feels that the sport represents another opportunity for footballers to flex their competitive muscles
there is that challenge when playing golf
as sportsmen we ve all got that in our lockers
we want to challenge each other we want to challenge ourselves and obviously be the best
that s why footballers turn to golf he told cnn
it can be a challenge if you want but i think it s good that you can actually have it as a casual game as well
some footballers play golf but do it as a hobby to relax and wind down and escape from the pressures of a football match on a saturday
but while golf is in good health when it comes to attracting footballers the sport has lost players in recent years according to a report in the new york times a recent survey by the us national golf foundation estimated the game has lost five million in the last decade with num of the existing num million golfers likely to quit in the next few years
many feel the game takes too long to play is too difficult to learn and has too many complicated rules which has led to a number of new alternatives being introduced to help boost a sport in decline
such concerns have led to the introduction on golf courses of num inchwide holes about four times the width of a standard hole a relaxation in the game s rules and of course footgolf
gaining a worldwide foothold since jansen s inaugural competition open to a mix of dutch and belgian professional footballers the sport has gone from strength to strength
three countries formed the fifg in june num for the first ever world cup in budapest hungary while today the world governing body boasts num different member nations ranging from south africa to argentina
a lot of people are getting involved and loving the sport
it s definitely the fun element that attracts people to it oconnor said
it catches such a large demographic because it s such a low skill level to be able to play
you ve just got to be able to kick a ball
and it is the sport s ability to appeal to all that means a footgolf course somewhere has likely played host to either a family visit a first date a corporate business trip or even as was the case in the uk an numyearold grandmother s day out with her grandson
but while there is little doubting the game s capacity to attract members from most walks of life oconnor feels luring newcomers at a young age is truly pivotal to footgolf s future and its capability to grow as a sport
when i first set up footgolf i knew a lot of people would want to play the sport and i knew i would not be alone in liking the idea of playing football on a golf course he said
but i was always conscious of the next level
i knew it would take off with adults but we started looking at how the sport could continue to grow and grow
and if you get the youngsters involved you re going to still be going in num num num years time and you will be continuing to build develop and progress
much to oconnor s surprise since its introduction the sport seems to have struck a particular chord with junior football coaches
there has been an overwhelming response from these coaches who have contacted uk footgolf to explain that the game is the perfect way to help youngsters focus on their passing and shooting
so much so that the governing body has taken the steps to set up its very own uk footgolf academy scheme due to start for business in may and headed up by hughes who previously played for birmingham city charlton athletic and hull city and is now a playerassistant manager at scarborough athletic
the scheme is currently being worked on with ukbased numstnumsport who develop training qualifications for the likes of the english football association and the english rugby football union and will range from including holiday camps for kids to qualification courses for future coaches
hughes will take on the role of academy director and like oconnor he feels the scheme can help to push the boundaries of footgolf even further
the concept of footgolf is something that really appeals to me and i m sure there is a massive amount of people that would really want to get involved with the academy scheme
the potential there is huge and it is something that i m really looking forward to hughes said
i do not think a lot of kids get the right sort of education when it comes to sport i think they just want to kick the ball against a wall nowadays
they need direction and for somebody to really push them a little to get them right up there and become the best they really can be
the scheme will give you that platform
as well as furthering the profile of the sport the academy scheme will be hoping to produce some of the footgolfers of tomorrow
a tour de force the figc currently stages a european tour with each of its different num member nations holding their own tournament throughout the year
some of the world s finest players go from competition to competition looking to accumulate points before a european champion is eventually crowned at the final stage in portugal in november
players travel from country to country because they love footgolf and they love trying different courses oconnor said
there s quite a small but cult following of people that do this
they all want to get ranked and be known as a good footgolfer not just in their own country but around the world
there are also a number of domestic tournaments taking place each year on various courses across the globe
the us currently leads the way when it comes to different courses with num while the uk now boasting num has made impressive progress to move up to second given it had just two at the beginning of num
with footgolf continuing to make huge strides both at home and abroad oconnor has high hopes for the sport and feels the sky is most certainly the limit
in five years time every country in the world that has got golf courses will be a member of the federation for international footgolf oconnor said
with the amount of inquiries we are getting from all over the place i have no doubt about that
we ve got somebody in togo asking us about joining the fifg
they ve only got one golf course in togo and they re talking about putting footgolf on it that s how big an impact the sport is having around the world

leaders in utah say they found a way to get around the government shutdown
utah will reopen its five national parks by saturday as well as three other nationally run locations
utah s governor gary herbert made the announcement thursday saying a deal had been reached with the us department of the interior secretary sally jewell
utah agrees to pay the national park service lrb nps rrb up to num million num per day to reopen eight national sites in utah for up to num days
if the federal government shutdown ends before then the state will receive a refund of unused monies an official press statement explained
the deal would reopen arches bryce canyon canyonlands capitol reef and zion national parks
the other three locations that will be opened are natural bridges and cedar breaks national monuments as well as glen canyon national recreation area
utah s national parks are the backbone of many rural economies and hardworking utahns are paying a heavy price for this shutdown herbert said in the released statement
i commend secretary jewell for being open to utah s solution and the world should know utah is open for business and visitors are welcome
october is an especially profitable month for utah s national parks since optimal weather attracts a high volume of tourists
typically officials estimate a num million yield for the month so the parks closures would have had an especially high impact on the state
the department of the interior is now awaiting a transfer of funds from utah at which point it will notify sitespecific personnel to return to work
the process of opening the parks after receiving the money should take some time but in a statement from the governor s office the state anticipates all sites should be fully operational by saturday
in the event that the federal government shutdown drags on longer than the num days that have been accounted for the state of utah insists it would be able to make additional payments to keep the parks operational
the agreement between herbert and jewell stipulates that the money spent by the state can be reimbursed with congressional approval
however as with other funds spent during the shutdown congress is under no obligation to refund the bill
it seems herbert is quite intent on pursuing repayment with his office telling reporters the governor has engaged utah s congressional delegation to actively pursue timely repayment to state coffers

new york lrb cnn rrb pedro hernandez was arraigned early friday evening on a seconddegree murder charge tied to the case of etan patz the new york boy whose disappearance num years to the day spurred nationwide attention about missing children
the suspect appeared about num pm friday via video feed from manhattan s bellevue hospital where he is being held for evaluation and is on suicide watch according to a law enforcement source
judge matthew sciarrino presided over the proceedings from a new york courtroom where people watched the arraignment
sciarrino denied bail for hernandez after defense attorney harvey fishbein said the suspect has a long psychiatric history including schizophrenia bipolar disorder and hallucinations
the lawyer asked that hernandez undergo a full psychiatric evaluation a request the judge granted
dressed in an orange jumpsuit and sitting at a brown table hernandez did not speak and showed no evident emotion during the proceedings
the next major step in the legal process would be for a grand jury to hear prosecutors evidence against hernandez for a potential indictment after the defense waived its right to an expedited indictment on friday
it is not clear when this might happen
earlier friday hernandez was sent to the hospital because he s on medications and we prefer to administer those in a hospital setting said police spokesman paul browne who declined to elaborate on the medications
when hernandez arrived at the hospital he began making statements that he wanted to die and a psychiatric evaluation was ordered added the law enforcement source
the former manhattan stock clerk who lived in etan s neighborhood when the boy vanished was arrested the previous day by police following up on a tip
neighbors say suspect in patz killing lived a quiet life with his family hernandez who was num in num told police he lured etan to a store with the promise of a soda choked him and placed his body in the trash about a block and a half away police commissioner ray kelly said
the boy was killed in the basement of a manhattan building according to the charging document filed late friday afternoon by the manhattan district attorney s office
detectives believe in the credibility of the statement kelly said although investigators had not uncovered any forensic evidence linking hernandez to the boy s disappearance
kelly said it is unlikely that etan s remains would be found
patz investigation a numyearlong roller coaster ride he did the right thing you know to confess hernandez s brotherinlaw jose lopez told cnn affiliate kyw
get this thing over with for the people out there and the family over here
but lisa cohen whose num book after etan is widely considered the definitive account of the case said she s not convinced that hernandez killed the boy
no i m not but that s not necessarily because he did not do it she said
that s just because this has just happened
i d never heard his name before
hernandez has no criminal record and is the father of a teenage girl kelly said
etan num went missing on may num num a block from his home in manhattan
he was walking to school alone for the first time when he vanished
his disappearance helped spawn a national movement to raise awareness of missing children including the thennovel approach of putting an image of the child s face on thousands of milk cartons
missing child case awakened america in the years after etan s disappearance hernandez told a family member and others that he had done a bad thing and killed a child in new york police said
while the motive remained unclear kelly described it as a crime of opportunity and said hernandez was remorseful
the detectives thought it was a feeling of relief on his part he said
other employees of the store were interviewed after etan disappeared but not hernandez police said
i ca not tell you why kelly said
the police investigation continues as does the fbi s the agency said in a statement thursday night
the fbi s investigation into the disappearance of etan patz remains active and ongoing
we remain determined to solve this case fbi assistant director janice k fedarcyk said in the statement
thursday s arrest came nearly a month after investigators searched the former basement workshop of carpenter othniel miller who had given etan a dollar the day before the boy s disappearance for helping him around the shop
etan had said before he disappeared that he planned to use the dollar to buy a soda
the search produced no apparent clues
mr miller is relieved by these developments as he was not involved in any way with etan patz s disappearance said miller s attorney michael c farkas
at the same time mr miller is very pleased that those responsible for this heinous crime may be brought to justice and the patz family may finally have the closure they deserve
a separate law enforcement source said thursday that hernandez s claims were being treated with a healthy dose of skepticism
the tipster whose information led to hernandez s arrest contacted authorities months ago after news coverage of their renewed search
that contact at least in part prompted investigators to question hernandez
a spokeswoman for the manhattan district attorney s office which reopened the case in num declined to comment on the recent development
etan was officially declared dead in num as part of a lawsuit filed by his family against jose antonio ramos a drifter and convicted child molester acquainted with etan s baby sitter
a judge found ramos responsible for the boy s death and ordered him to pay the family num million money the patz family has never received
although ramos was considered a key focus of the investigation for years he has never been charged in the case
he is serving a numyear prison sentence in pennsylvania for molesting another boy and is set to be released this year
president ronald reagan named may num the day etan went missing as national missing children s day

lrb wired rrb jawbone s up activitymonitoring wristbands have been failing at an alarming rate
three review units have failed during gadget lab testing numerous complaints of bricked units riddle jawbone s user forums and the clever health and fitness product currently receives just two out of five stars on amazoncom reviews num different user reviews were complaining of num bricked devices as of press time
today jawbone ceo hosain rahman issued a statement on jawbone s website explaining the cause of the failures and offered a comprehensive perhaps unprecedented refund program for anyone unhappy with his or her purchase
apparently problems with circuit board capacitors are to blame for the litany of units that have trouble keeping a charge exhibit erratic datarecording behavior or just plain stop working
rahman s message to customers reports the following we ve found an issue with two specific capacitors in the power system that affects the ability to hold a charge in some of our bands
we re also fixing an issue with syncing related to the band hardware
typically these issues surface within the first seven to ten days of use
the glitches are purely performance related and do not pose any safety risk
when the wristband works properly it records all your daytime footsteps and later provides a visual report of your walking running or hiking activity via a nifty ios app interface
you can also set the band to give you activity reminders gentle vibrations on your wrist that compel you to get out of your seat and take a few steps
the up system also offers nighttime sleep monitoring providing rich visual graphs detailing periods of deep and light sleep
well that s how the up system operates when working
in our experience with three different failed bands problems ran a frustrating gamut
one band issued random vibrations lrb even though no reminders were set rrb and consistently dropped data before failing to keep a charge and then dying completely
the other two bands simply exhibited syncing failures before bricking for good
in his statement rahman says that jawbone has temporarily paused production of the bands and will once again begin taking orders after the hardware s technical issues have been resolved
jawbone s vp of product management and strategy travis bogard told wiredcom we will bring it back as fast as we can
jawbone is also offering a no questions asked refund program for anyone who s purchased an up
starting tomorrow and running through december num num consumers who bought their up bands from authorized retailers will be granted full refunds and here s the big news be allowed to keep their bands
consumers experiencing hardware problems can also continue to receive replacement bands through jawbone s existing warranty program
in fact someone can collect a full refund as well as receive a replacement band as long as the band qualifies under warranty

islamabad pakistan lrb cnn rrb the taliban and the government of north west frontier province in pakistan have agreed to a permanent ceasefire in the nation s volatile swat valley an official said
girls study this week in pakistan s swat valley
education for girls is an issue in peace talks there
syed mohammad javed commissioner for the malakand region which includes swat valley told reporters in mingora that the two parties had agreed to make permanent a numday ceasefire declared earlier this week
javed said the agreement meant boys schools will reopen on monday and camps will be set up for swat residents who have fled the fighting or whose homes had been destroyed
the agreement comes as part of ongoing talks between sufi mohammad a protaliban cleric and his soninlaw maulana fazlullah the taliban commander in swat
taliban spokesman muslim khan confirmed the ceasefire
however fazlullah spoke on the radio saturday saying although the commissioner announced a permanent ceasefire the taliban will meet again after the numday truce expires and decide whether it will be extended
earlier this week pakistani government officials announced they had agreed with the taliban to allow strict islamic law or sharia to be implemented in the entire malakand division
watch what sharia law requires it marked a major concession by the pakistani government in its attempt to hold off taliban militants who have terrorized the region with beheadings kidnappings and the destruction of girls schools
the fighting has displaced nearly half of swat s population according to government sources
fazlullah said saturday the implementation of sharia law was very important for peace
like javed he said schools for boys will be opened soon
he said he was not against education of girls but against the syllabus of their education
the issue of education for girls was still under discussion javed said
nearly num people died as a result of militantrelated violence in pakistan in num according to the pakistan institute of peace studies

london england lrb cnn rrb if your neighbor mentions their green roof you might think they have a moss problem
maybe they are simply referring to the color
but you re unlikely to think that they have just had a mini ecosystem installed
majora carter says green roofs can help alleviate the problems caused by storm water simply put green roofs are gardens on your roof
they come in all shapes and sizes and range from a simple layer of turf to bitesized hanging gardens of babylon
but green roofs are not just aesthetic
they have important environmental benefits they absorb storm water reduce noise pollution absorb heat lrb thus lessening the urban heatisland effect rrb and add an extra layer of insulation to buildings
that s why they are increasingly being used on new builds as the construction industry looks to make use of greener technologies
the concept of a green roof goes back centuries the turf roofed dwellings of the vikings are early examples but the modern green roof we know today was developed in germany num years ago
since then they have become increasingly popular yet the industry still struggles against skeptics who believe green roofs to be expensive and liable to leaking
the exception to the rule has been germany where the industry is now annually worth num million
even by the end of the nums num million square meters of german roofs the equivalent of num percent of flat roofs were recorded to be green
the industry is not faring so well in other parts of the world
while the uk has seen a steady increase in interest since the nums a lack of input from the industry and policymakers has left britain far behind germany s booming market
in north america green roofs have taken even longer to catch on
green roofs for healthy cities a canadian nonprofit industry association conducted a survey in num which indicated that only num square meters of green roofs existed in north america
but this was up num percent from the previous year and the market continues to grow
majora carter who set up sustainable south bronx to help lift the area out of poverty by creating greencollar jobs is frustrated by this difference between the european and american industries
in germany they are down to num per square meter which is way cheaper than a regular roof here she told cnn
there are mandates over there because of the storm water they retain she continued which is a huge drain on their resources as it is on ours
what we are trying to do is champion the policies behind storm water
storm water is a growing problem in cities
the lack of permeable surfaces are loading drainage systems and increasing the risk of flooding
it s green roofs ability to retain high levels of precipitation that are seen as way to control and slow the water runoff
the mandates carter refers to are part of germany s green area and biotope area federal law
they are not a legal requirement but through incentives set up at a city level the mandates have helped to encourage cheaper prices
dusty gedge cofounder of livingrooforg a uk web site promoting the green roof industry believes it is the government s responsibility to help the industry grow
we need government bodies to accept certain civil engineering benefits such as storm water amelioration like the germans austrians and swiss do he told cnn
this will encourage uptake
in many countries the green roof industry is vulnerable to nonacceptance and a lack of understanding
gedge says there are problems with the construction industry viewing vegetation as a problem and not a benefit
green roofs also struggle against betterknown technologies such as solar panels but gedge points out solar panels can work better on green roofs than on gray roofs
despite this lack of support the green roof industry is growing
in london alone there are approximately num million square meters of green roofs planned with about num square meters already installed
and as climate change stays in the headlines the popularity of green roofs is growing
according to gedge over the last eight years green roofs lsb in the uk rsb have gone from being a very marginal approach to a mainstream approach
cities such as london and sheffield are now asking for them as part of planning applications
but gedge also believes that support from local government as opposed to a centrally driven policy is key to the industry s growth
in switzerland green roofs are federal law but again this is interpreted at a cantonal and city level he told cnn
this is a much better approach than driven by the center
managing the industry through federal laws offers a general framework which can then be interpreted as needed
in an industry that varies from project to project this flexibility is a valuable asset
so the green roof industry continues to grow but there s a feeling that government support could be better
with a little more encouragement what once was an eccentric way to roof your home could soon become the universal standard turning our cities into lush green metropolises
but then it s not easy being green
would you put a green roof on your home do green roofs really help the environment or are they an expensive indulgence share your views in the sound off box below

lrb cnn rrb the bostonarea man who planned to kidnap children rape and eat them is awaiting sentencing tuesday and is seeking a prison term of num years followed by lifetime supervised release according to court documents
geoffrey portway num who pleaded guilty in may to distribution and possession of child pornography and solicitation to commit a crime of violence submitted a document through his attorney to massachusetts district court on friday providing information to be used in imposing a sentence sufficient but not greater than necessary the court document says
the document includes background on the case cites similar cases and reasons for why portway agrees to a term of num years with a maximum of num years and num months
such reasons included the contention that he never engaged in inappropriate sexual conduct with a minor that portway will be required to register as a sex offender upon his release limiting his future employment options and there was no evidence that lrb portway rrb ever acted out any of his fantasies
portway a former computer operator also agreed to pay num in restitution fees
expta president accused of making child porn at elementary school federal authorities are recommending that he go to prison for at least num years according to other court documents filed last week
portway has pled guilty to some of the most vile and heinous crimes known to our society federal prosecutors wrote in a sentencing recommendation
but a lawyer for the numyearold defendant told cnn his client lived in a fantasy world and there was no evidence he harmed any child
cannibal cop convicted in new york after his arrest portway underwent mental health evaluations requested by his attorney who referred him to a clinical and forensic psychologist who assessed portway s risk for reoffending and the degree of danger he posed to the community according to courtfiled mental health evaluation documents
the documents describe a troubled childhood
his parents divorced when he was young and portman realized he was gay when he was num years old but was afraid to reveal it because his father was homophobic the evaluating psychologist dr eric l brown wrote
around the same time according to the evaluation he became increasingly fascinated with children s tales such as hansel and gretel in which two children are caged and fattened up so that a witch can eat them
pretzel bag leads feds to child porn suspect in california portway had a wish to be eaten that fulfilled a more basic desire to be wanted valued and incorporated by another person wrote dr brown
when portway s home in worcester was searched last year authorities found tens of thousands of computer images and videos of child pornography and num exchanges of child pornography between portway and the people he chatted with online
the images included children purportedly being cooked and prepared to be eaten court documents said
those photographs are sealed
authorities also found a locked basement court documents show
photos taken the day of portway s arrest and released by prosecutors show a narrow wooden staircase leading downstairs to a soundproof room
it was furnished with a metal cage with a circular hole for feeding a rusted and worn steeltopped table as well as multiple kinds of metal bondage equipment
a childsized coffin made of plywood was found on the floor nearby
smartphone app hunts for child predators portway s lawyer richard j sweeney told cnn that his client s sentencing hearing will be the proper time to address all the issues addressed by the government
but he added there s no evidence at all of geoffrey being involved with any child or harming any child
geoffrey lived in a fantasy world where he did liveaction role playing did things online unrelated to child porn and cannibalism
a lot of the chats that he had were in his mind fantasy sweeney said
when they went out to the other people he was talking to these other people actually had kids they were taking photos of
geoffrey did not have any kids he had abducted though he certainly talked about it
photographs reviewed by cnn show handcuffs rope intended for bondage bleach disposable scalpels and syringes mouth gags a butcher kit with multiple knives a childsized red onesie and castration tools
his dvd collection documents show included titles such as hansel and gretel the real cannibal holocaust the genesis children and cannibal ferox a film with the tagline make them die slowly
online chats seized by police showed portway called his basement a dungeon where he intended to keep kidnapped children while he sexually abused them and as a place to eventually murder and cannibalize the children

lrb cnn rrb is the dome doomed voters may have given the astrodome houston s iconic and once cuttingedge stadium the kiss of death
it s too early to write an obituary for the structure once deemed the eighth wonder of the world but the defeat of the bond initiative tuesday night stacks the odds against the dome
voters in harris county were given a voice on whether to issue num million in bonds to transform the deteriorating structure into a mammoth exhibition and event space
the county owns the astrodome and its commissioners had warned that if the measure did not pass the only course left would be to demolish it
the proposition was rejected by a num num vote
harris county judge ed emmett said that with voters rejecting the only viable public option and no viable private option on the table there s little choice but to demolish the dome the judge s spokesman joe stinebaker said
however nothing can happen until the county commission meets and votes to go ahead with the demolition
the item has not been added to the commission s agenda but it could happen as early as next tuesday
a majority of the commissioners had said that if the proposition failed that they would favor demolition
num imperiled and extinct sports sites nostalgia not lacking whether they voted for or against the measure to save the astrodome houstonians share a nostalgia for the stadium
completed in num it was the first domed stadium in the world and was deemed a remarkable feat of engineering
the dome was the primary home of the houston astros and the houston oilers in addition to hosting rodeos concerts and other events
stephen chmaitelli num remembers being dropped off at the astrodome with his friends as children and catching a ball game before walking to the nearby lrb and now defunct rrb astroworld theme park
it was a fun way to spend your days during the summer he said
there are just so many memories there
chmaitelli voted in favor of saving the dome based on the renderings he saw of the kind of space the new dome would be
the space would make it bigger than the city s convention center and the redesign would retain the feel of the old stadium while modernizing it
remodeling made economic sense he said the county could not buy land in such a prime location and erect a structure of such ambition for such a good price
the astrodome was always a symbol of pride for the city said bowen shepard a numyearold houston native
but he voted against the resolution because the structure had already begun to fall into disrepair years ago
the dome looked outdated sitting next to the more modern reliant stadium and fixing it up just did not seem worth the cost he said
everything has its time and everything s time comes to an end he said
endangered building months before the vote before it was even announced that a vote would be held the national trust for historic preservation included the astrodome on its yearly list of num most endangered historical places
on the same day that the harris county revitalization proposal was floated the trust named the dome one of num national treasures in the country
the designation meant that the trust put its resources to work in an attempt to save the astrodome
we re disappointed this morning beth wiedower a senior field officer for the trust said the day after the vote
i think lrb the outcome rrb was less of a comment on the value of the building the heritage associated with it and more the confusion that surrounded the astrodome these last years she said
for the past five years the astrodome has been essentially vacant
the electricity and water are still on but it is unoccupied and used mostly for storage
it costs the county an estimated num million to num million to maintain it the county said
several ideas from the private sector have appeared over the years but nothing with funding
as ideas have come and gone wiedower believes that many voters misunderstood that tuesday s vote may have been a definitive move on the building s fate
now that the votes have been cast and the astrodome is in serious jeopardy wiedower predicted there will be a great number of houstonians who will regret the loss of the stadium
if the city indeed has a change of heart at this point the only way out might be for a white knight from the private sector to swoop in with a plan said stinebaker the county judge s spokesman

lrb cnn rrb the national rifle association chief issued a blistering retort to president barack obama s inaugural address accusing him of name calling and limiting american freedoms
wayne lapierre had been relatively silent since his controversial response to the shooting massacre in newtown connecticut
after the december num shooting at sandy hook elementary school lapierre held one public news conference where he doubled down on the nra position more guns not fewer provide true security
in a speech late tuesday night he hit upon that same theme as he repeatedly criticized obama and his inaugural speech monday
president barack obama quoted the declaration of independence and he talked about unalienable rights
i would argue that his words make a mockery of both lapierre said at the annual blacktie weatherby international hunting and conservation awards in reno nevada
several times lapierre homed in on one part of obama s address where the president said we can not mistake absolutism for principle or substitute spectacle for politics or treat namecalling as reasoned debate
opinion guns were last straw for me with gop lapierre said the president was attacking fervent supporters of the second amendment
many of them believe it provides an absolute right to provide arms
when absolutes are abandoned for principles the us constitution becomes a blank slate for anyone s graffiti lapierre said
words do have meaning mr president
and those meanings are absolute especially when it comes to our bill of rights
the reemergence of the nra s potent mouthpiece comes on the same day of another school shooting that captured national headlines the wounding of three people on a texas college campus
his speech also comes as obama and some lawmakers focus on passing gun control measures
polls show more people are warming up to the possibility
last week obama proposed background checks on all gun sales and bans on militarystyle assault weapons and highcapacity magazines
with relatives of some of the num children killed in the connecticut rampage looking on obama also signed num executive actions which do not require congressional approval to strengthen existing gun laws
they also take related steps on mental health and school safety
in his speech tuesday lapierre set his sights on obama s proposal to expand background checks to anyone buying a gun whether at a store or in a private sale at an auction or convention
there are only two reasons for that federal list of gun owners to tax them or take them he told the cheering crowd
the titfortat continues a running battle between the president and the powerful gun lobby
last week the nra released an advertisement that called the president an elitist hypocrite and asked why he opposes the idea of placing armed guards in every school a proposal pushed by the nra despite the fact that his own children attend a school with similar security
the ad was only slated to air on the sportsman channel but has gained strong media attention both on the airwaves and online
it has also garnered criticism
republican gov chris christie of new jersey criticized it for making a reference to the president s children in a political attack commercial
speaking at a news conference last week the outspoken governor decried the move as reprehensible and argued that the group lost some credibility by making the ad
and i think for any of us who are public figures you see that kind of ad and you cringe
you cringe because it s just not appropriate in my view to do that he said
they ve got real issues to debate on this topic
get to the real issues
do not be dragging people s children into this
it s wrong
in his tuesday speech lapierre said obama was among the selfappointed arbiters of what freedom really means
he does not understand you
he does not agree with the freedoms you cherish
if the only way he can force you to give em up is through scorn and ridicule he s more than willing to do it even as he claims the moral high ground

we ve got another big game on sunday and we will give it all again frenchman wenger whose side trailed spurs by eight points in february told sky sports
it is sad lrb wigan rrb go down because they play good football with intelligent players
the defeat that sent wigan back to the second tier championship came just three days after roberto martinez s side won the fa cup stunning manchester city with a num victory at wembley
in the long history of english football wigan become the first side to be relegated in the same season as winning the fa cup a tournament that was first contested in num
nonetheless the wembley win means wigan garnered more silverware during their eight years in the premier league than rivals arsenal whose last trophy came when winning the fa cup at the end of the num season
i never expected this to happen said martinez whose side briefly rallied when shaun maloney made it num on the stroke of halftime
the group of players we have at the club are an incredible bunch and we did not deserve this
i am glad they showed what they were capable of winning the fa cup was an incredible achievement but this is a tough day for the club

we had an incredible eight years in the premier league and we need to build for the future the spaniard added
it s great to win the fa cup
it s an achievement that will live forever
the relegation is something we can rectify
the club is on a fantastic financial footing

caracas venezuela lrb cnn rrb speculation and messages of support surged in venezuela wednesday a day after president hugo chavez announced he would travel to cuba for surgery
doctors there will remove a lesion in the coming days from the same area of his body where doctors removed a cancerous tumor last year chavez said
the numyearold venezuelan leader told state media in a phone interview late tuesday that there was a high likelihood that the lesion was cancerous due to its location which he did not disclose
if it turns out to be malignant there will surely need to be another phase of radiation therapy and this would slow me down of course he said
in june chavez said doctors in cuba had removed a cancerous tumor but did not specify what type of cancer it was
he announced in october that treatment had cured him of cancer
word of the new operation which chavez first announced on state television tuesday afternoon comes at a critical time about seven months ahead of a presidential election
to my competitor a son of god as i am i wish him a successful operation a quick recovery and a long life opposition candidate henrique capriles radonski said wednesday in a twitter post
the president s allies sent strong messages of support
the president will have his treatment
the president will be with us in the campaign he will be our candidate and he is our candidate for october num
the revolution will continue with chavez in front said diosdado cabello president of venezuela s national assembly
but some venezuelans said they were skeptical
what surprises me is that the president had said before that his cancer was completely cured so it took all of us by surprise attorney lourdes rivas said
there is great anguish and uncertainty about whether he will be a candidate with such poor health
store owner carlos picardo said he was confident the venezuelan president would pull through
of course it s quite sensitive but he is going to come out of this like he has come out of everything else
he will survive this
and if he does not well he is mortal like all of us he said
in his interview with state television late tuesday chavez said he was confident he would leave a legacy in venezuela no matter what doctors discover
truly at this stage of life i am no longer myself
truly i am the people and i say this with much humility but that s how i feel
independently of the days years et cetera that may be left in my physical life i know that when i truly leave i will remain alive for many years i live in the people and the country he said

the brief order from the justices is a victory for supporters of federally funded testing to combat a range of diseases and illnesses
federal courts had previously lifted an injunction on continued funding and this latest high court action probably means the lawsuits will be ultimately dismissed
the field of embryonic stem cell research has been highly controversial because in most cases the research process involves destroying the embryo typically four or five days old after removing stem cells
these cells are blank and can become any cell in the body
because of the destruction of embryos most opponents believe this is a moral issue
supporters of the research point to the potential for saving lives
legislation passed in num prohibits the use of taxpayer dollars in the creation or destruction of human embryos for research purposes
private money had been used to gather batches of the developing cells at usrun labs
that congressional ban had been renewed annually
stem cells vs heart attacks the current administration had broken with the bush white house and issued rules in num permitting those cells to be reproduced in controlled conditions and for work on them to move forward
obama administration officials have been at odds with many members of congress over whether the national institutes of health research causes an embryo s destruction as prohibited by the dickeywicker act
in opposing the lawsuit the government had argued that an extensive list of research projects outlined by the government health research agency would have to be shelved if the courts blocked further funding
some scientists say that embryonic stem cells could help treat many diseases and disabilities because of their potential to develop into many different cell types in the body
in num the us court of appeals for the district of columbia lifted an injunction originally issued by a federal judge who said at the time that all embryonic stem cell research at the research agency amounted to the destruction of embryos in violation of congressional spending laws
the appeals panel later reversed concluding the plaintiffs bringing suit are unlikely to prevail because dickeywicker is ambiguous and the nih seems reasonably to have concluded that the law does not ban research using embryonic stem cells
stem cells help deaf gerbils hear the white house at the time applauded that ruling
while we do not know exactly what stem cell research will yield scientists believe this research could treat or cure diseases that affect millions of americans every year said stephanie cutter a deputy senior advisor to the president
that s why president obama has long fought to support responsible stem cell research
the case began with a lawsuit against the national institutes of health by james sherley and theresa deisher scientists opposed to the use of embryonic stem cells who worked with a group that seeks adoptive parents for human embryos created through in vitro fertilization including the nonprofit christian medical association
embryonic stem cell research differs from other kinds of stem cell research which do not require embryos
the current case does not deal with separate research on adult stem cells which is permissible under federal law
in num when president george bush first approved federal funding of human embryonic stem cell research num existing stem cell lines that were created before august num num qualified for federal funding
but of those only num were usable by scientists
bush later rescinded the funding
under the obama administration s rules at least num stem cell lines qualify for federal funding according to the national institutes of health
the nih has invested more than num million in human embryonic stem cell research
scientists conducting such research say continued federal funding is necessary because they would have greater flexibility to work collaboratively within labs across labs and around the world on the latest treatments and breakthroughs
supporters of embryonic stem cell research say their studies have shown promise in treating a range of debilitating conditions including diabetes parkinson s disease cancer and spinal cord injuries
the case is sherley v sebelius lrb num rrb
manchester new hampshire lrb cnn rrb newt gingrich is on the ropes tim pawlenty s dropped the gloves and mitt romney will be in the middle
it does not matter that sarah palin rudy giuliani and jon huntsman decided to stay home
the game is on
no more hedging statements exploratory committees or one more discussion with the family before deciding to jump into the water headfirst
the final boxes have been checked save for michele bachmann
for the six others the race for the gop presidential nomination begins monday night at the cnnwmurnew hampshire union leader debate
voters will be looking for the candidates to deliver answers on the pressing issues facing the nation and republican viewers will be watching for a candidate to take on president obama in num
early polling shows gop voters are not exactly enamored with the current field
perhaps that would change if palin and giuliani decided to run
huntsman told my cnn colleague candy crowley the other day that he is on the verge of making it official
he will run for president
an announcement is expected in the coming days
the former utah governor sees the lack of enthusiasm with the current field as an opening as long as gop primary voters do not punish him for serving as obama s ambassador to china
it is very early in the contest but still much is at stake for the frontrunner the perceived alternative the wounded the i told you so the unknowns and those waiting in the wings
here are five things to look for monday night that will help shape the race for the republican presidential nomination pawlenty vs romney for months we in the media have speculated that tim pawlenty is setting himself up to be the alternative to frontrunner mitt romney a fellow former governor
while romney must battle criticism that he is a flipflopper pawlenty is trying to overcome the perception that he lacks the edge needed to be a strong leader
pawlenty showed the sharpness of his political knife sunday when he accused romney of devising the framework for obama s health care law
and he coined a new word for the political dictionary obamneycare
pawlenty will try to show that he not only has the policy chops but is politically tough and savvy an important trait some gop voters will be looking for in their nominee to take on obama
but pawlenty must be careful he does not overreach in his criticism
romney who will be center stage must successfully weather the expected attacks punch back and effectively promote his ceo creds
romney a successful businessman is basing his campaign largely on his ability to fix the economy the no num issue facing this nation
monday night he will have the opportunity to sell it to a national audience and try to distinguish himself from his rivals
the wounded former house speaker newt gingrich made a politically questionable decision to take a mediterranean cruise during this critical building period of his newly launched campaign
when gingrich returned his staff fired him because they did not think he was committed to the campaign
there is no question that gingrich a former college professor is an intellect
he is a policymaking machine but the former speaker needs to show tonight that he is unshakable during a time of crisis and convince primary voters that the staff resignations are an insidebaseball story and he has the ceo qualities needed to run the nation
expect gingrich to follow ronald reagan s numth commandment which dictated thou shalt not speak ill of any fellow republican and instead focus his criticism squarely on obama
gingrich s goal is to try to convince gop voters he is the best candidate to defeat the president in num and the most experienced to deal with the woes that face the nation
i told you so at this time four years ago ron paul was a minor candidate at odds with his own party who was running a presidential campaign on a shoestring budget
times have changed and so has paul s status in the gop field
instead of polling in the low single digits he is now in the mid to highsingle digits is raising money at a healthy pace and is no longer considered a fringe candidate
what happened well his message seems to have resonated beyond his eclectic group of supporters made up of young adults antiwar activists and libertarianminded americans
he says the country is embracing his views especially his opposition to the wars and calls for us troops to leave afghanistan
tonight paul will be the same paul that stood on this same stage in manchester four years ago except this time he has more support and more money
but his message will be the same and do not be surprised if he says i told you so
the unknowns rick santorum once held a senior republican leadership position in the senate michele bachmann is a member of congress and herman cain is a successful businessmanturnedtalk show host
each is well known in social conservative circles and is vying for the support of this key voting bloc
yet these three republicans are not household names
they face the difficult task monday night of striking a balance delivering redmeat rhetoric at the same time they re introducing themselves to a broader audience
bachmann cain and santorum are competing for the same voters and thus risk splitting the vote three ways
monday night each will make a targeted pitch claiming to be the true social conservative in the hopes of cementing that status with this important voting bloc
waiting in the wings what will they say during and after the debate will sarah palin post a statement on facebook criticizing the policies put forward by the debate participants perhaps praise them will giuliani weigh in on the debate or simply ignore it and will huntsman who is just days away from joining the field pick apart his future rivals answers betting money is that giuliani remains mum huntsman offers a critique and palin will have something to say on her facebook page
lrb cnn rrb eliot spitzer who resigned as governor of new york in the wake of a prostitution scandal is looking at a return this time as comptroller of new york city
he said he hoped that voters would be able to see beyond his past
i accepted responsibly for what i did spitzer told cnn late sunday night
i spent five years of working doing useful things and i hope the public will offer me an opportunity
spitzer a democrat resigned in num after revelations about his relationship with a prostitute
since stepping down he has worked as a commentator for various news outlets including cnn
in running for comptroller spitzer said he s looking for forgiveness and a second chance
the metaphor is what i did with the attorney general s office he said
it is ripe for greater and more exciting use of the office s jurisdiction
besides serving as governor spitzer was new york s attorney general
spitzer said he has his wife s support as he jumps back into political life but does not know if she will be joining him on the campaign trail
a senate report delivered a scathing indictment tuesday of torture policies that officially ended when president barack obama came into office but another holdover from the bushera war on terrorism is keeping obama tethered to the previous administration
nearly six years after obama signed an executive order on his third day in office to begin the process of shutting down the guantanamo bay detention camp in cuba num prisoners remain in military custody on the us naval base despite the release of six more prisoners just this week
about num have been released since num
obama may have ended the cia s torture program but his administration has yet to come close to shutting down guantanamo which has become an international symbol of us abuses in the postnum num war on terror
and the torture report s release prompted a nearly numyear detainee of the notorious prison to recount the severe mistreatment he endured writing in a cnn opinion column that the report is just the start of what americans have to accept happened in their name
samir naji al hasan moqbel a yemeni man accused of serving in osama bin laden s security detail described conditions at guantanamo that included the repeated seemingly incessant interrogations he faced at the hands of us officials
also on this story my treatment shames american flag the abuses alleged by the prisoner are similar to those outlined in the senate report which focused on the interrogations of detainees held in secret overseas facilities in the years after the september num num terrorist attacks on new york and washington
naji listed sleep deprivation humiliation and beatings abuses similar to those described as tantamount to torture in a num international committee of the red cross report leaked to the new york times
naji also described the painful forcefeeding he has been subjected to as he and as many as num other prisoners have engaged in hunger strikes to protest their continued detention without charge
cnn could not independently verify the claims made in naji s editorial piece
when contacted by cnn the national security council said it would not comment on individual claims such as naji s
the abuses asserted by naji were also suffered by other detainees at guantanamo said tom wilner an attorney who has represented guantanamo detainees in two cases that went before the us supreme court
cold cells uncomfortable positions beating them up making them pee in their pants the sexual taunting it was all within the range of what was done to many of them said wilner who represented num kuwaitis detained in guantanamo from num to num
guantanamo fast facts his clients also spoke of the pornography room that naji mentions in his column wilner said
naji said he was forced to view pornographic images of women and men as his interrogators stripped him of his clothes
i ve heard worse
i ve heard that they had women come in and touch them which for muslim men is a terrible thing said wilner who has visited gitmo num times
an international human rights legal group representing naji and several other guantanamo detainees contends that the abuses were common
almost every one of my clients has reported identical treatment to what samir details in this piece said alka pradhan counterterrorism counsel for reprieve us an international human rights nongovernmental organization headquartered in london
reprieve represents a total of num guantanamo detainees including nationals from yemen pakistan tunisia and the united kingdom pradhan said
pradhan however was not involved in the preparation of naji s oped which is written in naji s words she said
some of the abuses continue pradhan charged
they are still in freezing cells they still have problems with food and they are still being treated roughly or hit by the guards she said
recently this past summer lrb the detainees rrb had incredibly invasive genital searches whenever they left their cells to receive a phone call or meet with their attorneys said pradhan who has visited gitmo three times
some of them felt they were being penetrated she said of the searches
it s just that the torture continues in different forms but as long as the government applies this secrecy to guantanamo bay we wo not find out until years after the fact
guantanamo bay what happens when detainees held for years get out guantanamo detainees of which there have been nearly num were allegedly tortured at the site drawing widespread international condemnation from human rights and civil liberties advocates who decried the interrogation techniques and the us authority to detain the suspected terrorists without charges
nearly all guantanamo prisoners are being held without charges and while about half of those are considered highlevel threat detainees the remainder were determined to be lowlevel threats by a task force of top us intelligence and law enforcement agencies
those in the latter group could gain their freedom provided security conditions could first be met in their host countries
security concerns have set back and stalled the shuttering of the notorious facility and the release of guantanamo prisoners has drummed up serious opposition in congress on both sides of the aisle
in december num congress amended the annual defense budget bill to prevent the transfer of any guantanamo detainees to the united states
that defeated the obama administration s plans announced a year earlier to try several guantanamo detainees involved in the num terrorist attacks in us federal court
among those khalid sheikh mohammed a mastermind of the num world trade center attacks was slated to be flown to new york to face trial in federal court
isis fast facts the num legislation also banned obama from using federal funds to build a detention facility to house the guantanamo detainees on us soil under existing authority
us officials have defended the indefinite detention of suspected terrorists without trial or charges as legitimate under laws of war saying that congress num authorization for use of military force against al qaeda allows the united states to detain those enemy combatants until the fight against al qaeda and associated groups like isis ends
it is of course unclear when that fight could or would reach an official conclusion
but members of congress continue to oppose the release of guantanamo detainees even those considered lowlevel threats because of the risk that they could engage in terrorism against the united states
about num of the total of num detainees released from guantanamo most during president george w bush s presidency have since engaged in terrorist activities according to the september num semiannual report from the director of national intelligence
another num are suspected of engaging in terrorist or insurgent activities
even if all the detainees recommended for release by the interagency task force are transferred out of guantanamo about num detainees would remain according to the new york times
so we re stuck with guantanamo pradhan said
now we re in a hole
i tend to be a pessimist about it
no matter what the president continues to say i do not think this is his priority anymore she added
those detainees include mohammed and a handful of others slated for trial under the military commission system as well as dozens who are considered serious highlevel threats but could not be tried and convicted and that legal limbo is the ultimate conundrum obama faces as he looks to make good on a longoverdue campaign promise to close the facility before his term ends
and while just four guantanamo detainees were released under leon panetta s num tenure as defense secretary obama renewed his commitment to closing the prison in num
since then num prisoners have been transferred to other countries under secretary of defense chuck hagel s tenure the new york times reported
those included five mid to highlevel taliban militants who were released from guantanamo this spring in exchange for the release of us army sgt bowe bergdahl who was being held by taliban forces in afghanistan
and the specter of isis has stoked more fears in washington that former detainees could attack the united states or americans abroad if freed
case in point the us military released abu bakr albaghdadi who was captured in num and held at camp bucca a usrun prison in iraq
he was released later that year
he went on to become the leader of isis and is the selfdeclared caliph of the socalled islamic state
lrb cnn rrb campus police at the university of south florida were questioning two men in connection with backtoback incidents on the school campus monday
police take a man into custody at the university of south florida after receiving reports of a person with a bomb
investigators were questioning one man following a report of an armed intruder usf police lt meg ross said
and a second man was also being questioned following a report of a man carrying a large hunting knife and a puppy she said
usf police asked the tampa police s bomb team to respond to the campus regarding a backpack belonging to man in the first incident said ross
no one was hurt she said and no shots were fired
we have someone we think may have been involved ross told cnn but we have to investigate fully
we have not looked in his backpack she added
we have the bomb squad on their way to look at that
police received a report that a person armed with a bomb and a gun was in the area of the university s library
authorities later received a report of a subject on a bus in the area of the university s parking and transportation services ross said
we checked the area at the library did not locate him but then received a subsequent report of a subject on a bus she said
the campus stayed on lockdown after police received a report almost immediately after taking the first man into custody of a man wearing a black tank top and a cowboy hat carrying a knife and a black puppy
we re questioning him ross said
we do not believe he is related to the first incident with the backpack
text messages were sent out to num employees and num students to warn them after the first incident and emergency sirens on campus also were activated officials said
but ross said that the campus had been given the allclear except for the shuttlebus area where the first subject was taken into custody while tampa police examined the backpack
cnn s rich phillips contributed to this report
lrb cnn rrb the university of north carolina has launched its own investigation into claims highlighted by cnn that too many of its studentathletes read poorly
chancellor carol folt posted an open letter to campus saying i take these claims very seriously but we have been unable to reconcile these claims with either our own facts or with those data currently being cited as the source for the claims
moreover the data presented in the media do not match up with those data gathered by the office of undergraduate admissions
the university also released some of its own data which it claims shows that the allegations of academic problems highlighted in a cnn investigation by whistleblower mary willingham are not true
folt s letter said only two of the num studentathletes admitted in num and num fell below the sat and act levels that were cited in a recent cnn report as the threshold for reading levels for firstyear students
and those two students are in good academic standing
but a larger analysis of sat and act entrance exam scores released to cnn show the situation is not so bright
unc data shows that since num the university admitted num players to play in the revenuegenerating sports of football and basketball who scored below a num on the sat verbal test or below a num on the act reading and english tests
that s num of those athletes admitted under special talents to play football or basketball
willingham reported num of studentathletes playing in revenue sports were reading below a thirdgrade level as part of a research project that was university approved
however willingham s research included other factors and used a smaller sample size
on thursday cnn talked to a psychologist who administered the academic achievement test that willingham used in her research and that psychologist backed up willingham s findings
the psychologist who asked not to be identified said a spreadsheet with the results of the tests was given to unc academic support center staff each year the testing was done
you have to do really badly on that test to get a low score the psychologist also said noting that some studentathletes scored even lower on later evaluations
i have the utmost confidence in mary s integrity and she s trying to do the right thing and always has the psychologist said
the sat and act thresholds were used by cnn after consulting several experts to represent a reading level too low to understand college textbooks
that was the standard applied to several universities as part of cnn s national look at the reading levels of college athletes
unc officials talked with willingham a learning specialist on monday in what they said was a cordial meeting willingham described it as being condescending
but the university continues to dispute her findings
and her university approval to do the research was pulled thursday by unc willingham said partly because she was aware of the identity of some of the athletes in her findings
while unc says it will do its own review of what willingham found it also disputes the claim that it admitted students who could not do work at unc
there have been num students evaluated in detail at length and we believe were capable of succeeding here said steve farmer unc s director of undergraduate admissions referring to the num who scored below the threshold
when we evaluate someone we do not just rely on one score
farmer also pointed out that in num no studentathletes were admitted with scores below the threshold and in num only two studentathletes in the revenue sports were admitted with scores that low
cnn first requested comment from the university on willingham s research back in september
the university originally said it was not aware of the research then later said the university would not comment
only after the story was published has the university responded to cnn s requests for information
two years ago unc s own internal investigation uncovered an academic scandal in which several athletes were enrolled in classes where little or no work was required
the north carolina attorney general recently indicted a former professor who allegedly accepted money for teaching those noshow classes
willingham who has spoken publicly about that scandal and has received threats since talking to cnn insists she worked with several studentathletes who would not have been able to read this article on the day they were admitted to college
we were going back to letters and sounds willingham told cnn recounting stories of athletes one who could not read multisyllabic words

new orleans louisiana lrb cnn rrb the verdict so far generally good news but still some uncertainty about whether there s a leak in bp s well in the gulf of mexico now fitted with a containment cap
that s the assessment of the retired coast guard admiral overseeing the government s response to the oil spill more than num hours into a critical test checking the well s ability to hold up under pressure
thad allen reported friday afternoon that pressure is rising in the well a sign that the well is holding and that the leak that had been spewing oil into the gulf for nearly three months can be contained
but pressure readings have not reached the optimal level
pressure was up to num pounds per square inch inside the well s capping stack he said
more than a day into the well integrity test pressure above num pounds per square inch would indicate high integrity and low potential for a leak according to allen
what does num pounds per square inch mean government scientists and bp experts are not quite sure
it could be a leak or it could simply be that so much oil has spilled out already it s taking a while to build up pressure
in general as the president noted today this is generally good news allen said
but he added i think we re at a point where there s enough uncertainty about the meaning of the pressure that we re seeing that we have to use due diligence moving forward
we do not want to do harm or create a situation that can not be reversed
allen said the government has told bp to proceed with the test but intensify monitoring of the well by conducting seismic and acoustic tests and visual inspections of the sea floor using robots
in addition a government ship is in the area fitted with equipment for detecting methane gas which would be an indication of a leak
the well integrity test began thursday after two days of delays first as government scientists scrutinized testing procedures and then as bp replaced a leaking piece of equipment known as a choke line
the oil stopped gushing out thursday afternoon the first time bp has been able to gain control since the deepwater horizon rig exploded april num and triggered the catastrophe
all that was made possible by a new tightly fitting containment cap
bp senior vice president kent wells said later in a telephone conference following allen s that two robots trolling the sea floor in the area of the well bore and two others capturing sonar data have not detected any breaching
at this point there is no evidence the well bore has been breached so that s good news he said
the current monitoring that we do shows no negative evidence
he said the well integrity test is proceeding as planned and the pressure readings so far while not optimal are consistent with bp s engineering analysis and do not give us any indication that we do not have well integrity
wells said also said that work restarted friday on the drilling of the first of two relief wells seen as a more permanent way to plug and seal the breached well
they re expected to be completed in august
one serves as a backup to the other
when they are ready mud and cement will be pumped into one of the relief wells to permanently seal bp s crippled well
allen and bp officials initially had said that the test results would be closely scrutinized at sixhour intervals and that the integrity test could go on for num hours
but at this point they re focusing on each six hours with no guarantee the test will last two days
when the test is wrapped up valves are expected to be reopened to resume siphoning oil to two ships on the surface the qnum and helix producer as government and bp officials assess the data and decide what to do next
two more ships are due to join them in coming weeks bringing containment capacity to num barrels lrb about num million gallons rrb of oil a day more than highend estimates of how much oil had been leaking
but it s possible some oil may be released into the gulf again before all the ships are ready
as results came in friday morning president barack obama spoke about the developments with a note of caution
i think it s important that we do not get ahead of ourselves here he said
you know one of the problems with having this camera down there is that when the oil stops gushing everybody feels like we re done and we re not
we wo not be done until we actually know that we killed the well and have a permanent solution in place
the president expects to return to the gulf coast in the next few weeks
the white house announced that first lady michelle obama will return to the gulf region next week to meet with coast guard personnel who ve been responding to the oil spill and to christen a coast guard cutter named in honor of dorothy stratton the service branch s first female commissioned officer
the visit will take place in mississippi on friday
meanwhile gulf residents are happy simply that no oil is being released now
see the smile that s my reaction jamie munoz said
but it s cautious optimism
obviously i m very happy
it s been our goal for num days now
it s been a long run
but hopefully we get it done right and begin the cleaning
that s the most important part
let s clean up and get our fishermen back to work
bp also reported that it has paid more than num million in claims to num gulf coast residents
the largest groups of claimants include fishermen who have received num million and shrimpers who have received num million the company said in a news release
it said that about num million has been paid for loss of income to workers on ships at seafood processing plants and other businesses
lrb cnn rrb it s every flier s worst nightmare your pilot announces we re all going down and starts shouting about bombs and terrorists
he abandons the cockpit frantically running up and down the aisles like a man unhinged
what do you do that s what passengers on a jetblue flight had to decide tuesday when their pilot capt clayton osbon seemed to have a meltdown in the air between new york and las vegas
fortunately for everyone on board a quickthinking copilot and some alert passengers snapped into action
initial reports suggest that at least four passengers leapt to their feet and subdued the pilot who had been trying to break down the cockpit door after his copilot locked him out
the heroic passengers have been praised for their bravery and rightly so they may have saved num lives on the plane and maybe more on the ground
it s hard to hear this story and not admire their swift and effective action and wonder how you d respond in the same situation
would you jump up and subdue a hysterical pilot or sit paralyzed in your seat hundreds of studies have explored the socalled bystander effect trying to determine why some observers respond positively to a crisis while others ignore it
the research points to a somewhat surprising conclusion generally speaking only subtle differences separate the bystanders from the heroes
most of us it seems can fall into either category depending on the details of a situation
the jetblue crisis highlights some of the factors that can make a difference suggesting how we can get people ourselves included to take action in an emergency
it might seem obvious that when confronted with a raving man attacking a cockpit door people would realize they should do something to stop him
but that s not always the case especially when they re part of a large crowd
in fact in one famous study social psychologists john darley and bibb latane left people alone in a room and pumped in smoke a pretty clear warning sign of danger maybe on par with a numpound guy in a pilot s uniform shouting incoherently about iran and iraq
when people were alone in the room they left and reported the smoke to someone else num of the time
but when there were three people in the room they reported the smoke num of the time illustrating the problem psychologists call pluralistic ignorance where we mistake other people s inaction as a sign that everything s actually ok
after all no one wants to be the fool who tackles your plane s pilot because you misread the situation maybe he was just playing a practical joke when we do not see anyone else respond we tend to assume there is not really a crisis as a result we inadvertently hold each other back
but response rates shoot up dramatically when one bystander simply acknowledges to another that there might be a problem
so on the jetblue flight it helped tremendously that the copilot and a flight attendant had the presence of mind to use the public address system to call on the passengers to restrain the pilot
it becomes nearly impossible to assume there is not really a problem when your acting captain says there is
yet even once we recognize there s a problem in crowds we often fall prey to what s called a diffusion of responsibility where we assume the people around us are going to help so there s less of a need for us to take action ourselves
research by darley and others shows that the greater the number of people who witness a crisis the lower the odds that any of them will do anything
to overcome this it helps when we re singled out personally
darley once told me that if you ever sprain your ankle in public do not just call for help pick out someone in the crowd and say hey you there can you give me a hand on the jetblue flight it seems like the crew only made a blanket appeal to the passengers for help which probably was not as effective as it could have been
only four passengers out of nearly num sprang to action responsibility still might have been pretty diffused
but it likely helped that several of the plane s passengers were retired or offduty law enforcement on their way to a security convention in las vegas
darley s research has found that personality does not necessarily predict whether someone will help
what s more important is whether bystanders have the experience to recognize a crisis when it s unfolding and feel like they have the skills to do something about it
so it probably should come as no surprise that among those who sprang to action one was a former prison guard and another was an exnew york police sergeant with num years of experience on the force
that sergeant paul babakitis told cbs news that when he saw the pilot running amok my training immediately kicked in
he said he believed he was deranged when he looked into his eyes because he had dealt with a lot of emotionally disturbed people during my time on the force
people who have experience in law enforcement or the military are probably better at recognizing a crisis because they re less likely to convince themselves that this could not be happening to them could it of course pluralistic ignorance might be harder for any of us to maintain on a plane after num even num years later
it s harder today to rule out the plausibility of any crisis
indeed babakitis said he immediately thought of that day when he saw osbon storming the cockpit
not again he told himself not while i m on this plane

he was num
john updike won many literary awards
his books such as the witches of eastwick were also bestsellers
updike passed away tuesday morning after battling lung cancer
he lived in beverly farms massachusetts
he was one of our greatest writers and he will be sorely missed said nicholas latimer vice president of publicity at updike s publisher alfred a knopf
updike was a rarity among american writers a muchesteemed prizewinning author whose books including rabbit run lrb num rrb couples lrb num rrb the witches of eastwick lrb num rrb and terrorist lrb num rrb were also bestsellers
updike won the pulitzer prize twice for rabbit is rich lrb num rrb and its successor rabbit at rest lrb num rrb

in the books which also included num s rabbit redux and a num novella rabbit remembered onetime basketball star harry rabbit angstrom negotiates marriage divorce wealth and health problems never quite understanding the larger forces shaping his life
rabbit is not a character calculated to inspire affection but he is an unflinchingly authentic specimen of american manhood and his boorishness makes his rare moments of vulnerability and empathy that much more heartbreaking wrote time s lev grossman in naming rabbit run to time s alltime num novels list
updike was incredibly prolific penning essays reviews short stories poetry and memoirs
his works frequently appeared in the new yorker including a famed num essay about ted williams final game hub fans bid kid adieu
no writer was more important to the soul of the new yorker than john said david remnick the editor of the magazine in a statement
even though his literary career transcended any magazine he was obviously among the very best writers in the world he still loved writing for this weekly magazine loved being part of an enterprise that he joined when he was so young
we adored him remnick continued
he was for so long the spirit of the new yorker and it is very hard to imagine things without him

we honor his memory and his contributions and massachusetts today bids him a sad and wistful adieu of our own
updike never won a nobel prize but one of his characters henry bech received one in bech at bay lrb num rrb
his works particularly given their sexual content could be as divisive as they were poetic
many critics accused him of misogyny and others accused him of using his graceful prose to cover thin subject matter and updike put out his prose by the ream
it seems to be easier for john updike to stifle a yawn than to refrain from writing a book the literary critic james wood wrote in the london review of books in num
but his frank discussion of sex also garnered him many readers the cover of time magazine lrb for num s couples rrb and a lifetime achievement bad sex in writing award from great britain s literary review
he was criticized by norman mailer hailed by fellow author lrb and updike obsessive rrb nicholson baker in u and i and even appeared as an animated version of himself on a simpsons episode as the ghostwriter of a krusty the klown book
lsb i rsb was flattered to be asked to be one of the many voices that they worked into the endless saga of springfield updike said noting that the hardest part of his performance was producing a chuckle
john hoyer updike was born march num num in reading pennsylvania and grew up in shillington
from an early age he took to reading and writing and earned a full scholarship to harvard where he headed the harvard lampoon
upon graduation he accepted a oneyear fellowship to oxford university in england
by the time he was num he had been offered a position at the new yorker which was to become his literary home over the next numplus years
updike s first novel the poorhouse fair came out in num
the next year in rabbit run he introduced angstrom who was to become one of the most famous characters in american fiction
when introduced rabbit is a man fleeing his pregnant wife the songs on the car radio reflecting both the era and his life
over the course of the rabbit books the character would routinely infuriate his spouse mistresses and offspring try to make things right and never quite succeed
his attitude did not help
men are all heart and women are all body
i do not know who has the brains
god maybe the character said in rabbit run
rabbit run was successful as were updike s other nums books including the centaur lrb num rrb which featured a teacher much like updike s father and the short story collection the music school lrb num rrb
but it was couples that made updike a household name
the book about a group of spouses engaging in the sexual revolution in suburban massachusetts became a no num bestseller
updike s interests ranged widely
he wrote about an african state in the coup lrb num rrb
he discussed the relationship between science and religion in roger s version lrb num rrb
he revisited hamlet in gertrude and claudius lrb num rrb
and he created a group of promiscuous witches in the witches of eastwick lrb num rrb which became a hit movie in num starring jack nicholson as the devil
though updike s work routinely sold well he was painfully aware of the decline of what s come to be called literary fiction
in a num interview with salon he lamented its difficulties
when i was a boy the bestselling books were often the books that were on your piano teacher s shelf
i mean steinbeck hemingway some faulkner
faulkner actually had considering how hard he is to read and how drastic the experiments are quite a middleclass readership he said
but certainly someone like steinbeck was a bestseller as well as a nobel prizewinning author of high intent
you do not feel that now
and yet updike himself never lost his zest for the written word and the pleasure brought by jotting tuning refining creating a new story even as the years drifted by
an aging writer has the not insignificant satisfaction of a shelf of books behind him that as they wait for their ideal readers to discover them will outlast him for a while he wrote in aarp the magazine late last year
the pleasures for him of bookmaking remain and retain creation s giddy bliss
among those diminishing neurons there lurks the irrational hope that the last book might be the best
updike s most recent novel the widows of eastwick came out in num

earthquake experts worldwide expressed shock at the manslaughter convictions of six italian scientists who failed to predict the deadly laquila quake warning that the decision could severely harm future research
two scientists resigned their posts with the government s disaster preparedness agency tuesday after a court in laquila sentenced six scientists and a government official to six years in prison
the court ruled monday that the scientists failed to accurately communicate the risk of the num quake which killed more than num people
luciano maiani the physicist who led the national commission for the prediction and prevention of major risks resigned in protest of the verdict tuesday afternoon italy s civil protection agency announced
the situation created by the sentencing yesterday on the facts from laquila is incompatible with a clear and effective performance of the functions of the commission and its role as a consulting bodies for the state maiani said in a statement released by the agency
in addition mauro dolce quit as director of the office that monitors volcano and earthquake threats the agency said
dolce will be given another post it said
seismologists were aghast at the court s decision noting that earthquakes remain impossible to forecast with any kind of accuracy
to predict a large quake on the basis of a relatively commonplace sequence of small earthquakes and to advise the local population to flee would constitute both bad science and bad public policy said david oglesby an associate professor in the earth sciences faculty of the university of california riverside
if scientists can be held personally and legally responsible for situations where predictions do not pan out then it will be very hard to find scientists to stick their necks out in the future oglesby said in a statement
prosecutors argued that the scientists gave inaccurate incomplete and contradictory information about the dangers facing laquila at a meeting a week before the magnitudenum num quake
the experts determined that it was unlikely but not impossible that a major quake would take place despite concern among the city s residents over recent seismic activity
the court agreed finding the six scientists from the national institute of geophysics and volcanology and a member of the civil protection agency guilty and ordering italian authorities to pay num million euros lrb num million rrb in damages
it s chilling that people can be jailed for giving a scientific opinion in the line of their work roger musson the head of seismic hazard and archives at the british geological survey wrote in a comment published on the organization s twitter feed
comments from one of the defendants enzo boschi former president of the national institute of geophysics and volcanology suggested that the scientists were shellshocked by their conviction
i m dejected despairing
i still do not understand what i m accused of boschi said after the ruling according to ansa italy s official news agency
boschi and the six others convicted monday will remain free during the appeal process
the italian geophysics institute expressed regret and concern about the verdict in a statement monday
it said the ruling threatens to undermine one of the cornerstones of scientific research that of freedom of investigation of open and transparent discussion and sharing of results
some experts have argued that the issue was a failure of communications not calculations
domenico giardini who held boschi s old job at the institute for several months said last year that the trial was about the number of weak points in the communication chain
we all have to work on new and more clear protocols on the transfer of information said giardini who now conducts research in switzerland
survivors of the num quake some of whom who lost relatives or property in the disaster have voiced anger at the officials who downplayed the risks despite the worries expressed by residents
i can understand the grief of people who lost loved ones and the frustration that people feel when terrible events happen especially ones outside their control oglesby said
convicting honest scientists of manslaughter does nothing to help this situation and may well put a chill on exactly the kind of science that could save lives in the future
the ruling may well change the way experts disclose their opinions according to david spiegelhalter a professor specializing in the public understanding of risk at cambridge university in britain
laquila trial shows public scientists need to take media communication very seriously he wrote on his twitter account
and get indemnity
lrb cnn rrb we ve all done it surfed on over to the book of faces our hearts racing and pupils dilating with excitement let our cursors linger over those ohsopowerful words remove from friends and clicked away with the maniacal glee of a serial killer
still there are not that many among us who have the skill the expertise to cut ties without cutting deep
at this point some of you may be reminiscing about the sepiatinged past those glory days when if you did not want to chill with lucy i eat paste smith anymore all you had to do was ghost out of her life letting the last tendrils of your friendship dissolve into the ether like wisps of smoke
well those days are as dead as lucy s creepy gray front teeth
now every time someone exits your life you have to decide whether to keep them in your facebook stream or cut the lifeline
friends and acquaintances come and go as we move through life stages and find the need for keeping some friends and losing others says dr larry rosen author of rewired understanding the igeneration and the way they learn
if you had no way to unfriend someone then this would lose the authenticity of having a relationship
you hear that unfriending is practically doctorapproved
still how do you know when and how to take the paleviscerating plunge read on for our tips on handling unfriending situations
the exfriend we ve all nixed an exfriend at one time or another
one group is even urging users to purge their facebook feeds of annoying pals this week by declaring it deleteafriend week
in fact in an online poll of about num of our friends and readers num percent said they were most likely to ax a close acquaintance when erasing a facebook friendship
said axing usually happens because of one of two scenarios one your best guy friend s girlfriend hates you a situation that led to a knockdown dragout fight at a local watering hole
two you used to chill with this dude back when you lived in illinois dreaming of the jug band you would form when you moved to the big city
now you actually live in the big city where you do indeed have a jug band lrb ironically of course rrb and homeboy is still back in the cornfields
in scenario one it would probably be a good idea to reach out one last time in the realworld realm and see if you can sort out whatever bs went down at the bar
if in the end your former best boy persists in the venomspewing and unpleasantries it s probably more healthy to remove him from that glorious realm of timewastery
seeing his face pop up among photos of muriel s wedding and marco s new kitten ai not gon na do much for your sanity
in scenario two it s up to you to gauge how much cornfield s presence offends you
according to christopher sibona who penned unfriending on facebook friend request and onlineoffline behavior analysis a paper he will be presenting at the hawaii international conference on system sciences num percent of people who have unfriended someone saw the person in question zero times in the past year
if your former friend has no impact on your current life and you do not foresee yourself getting the band back together why keep him in your cyber stable lrb if you re one of those other num percent who see the faded friend on a more frequent basis you may want to rethink the unfriend
nothing is more awkward than attending a party replete with ghosts of camaraderie past
rrb the ex most of the time it s probably best to hit unfriend after the whole it s not you it s me talk
out of sight out of mind and all that
but it seems like a lot of folks like to keep tabs on their exes via facebook only num percent of those surveyed said that they were most likely to unfriend an ex
hey i guess it s easier to make drunken nostalgic mistakes when you still have access to their wall huh if you do decide to take the plunge be gentle
if you re the dumper cut your ex a break let himher unfriend you
it s the least you can do after putting hisher heart through this meat grinder called love
if you re the dumpee and the object of your unrequited attention feeds you some line about still wanting to be friends lrb an option that s about as enticing as forming a cuddle pile with your ex her new dude and a couple of rabid skunks rrb send her a message before you clickyclick her outta your life
now if your ex is basically el diablo just take aim and fire
and no one will blame you if you let out the littlest of evil laughs whilst doing the blocking or unfriending deed
the enemy who friended you yup
he tortured you in grade school by mocking your name your shoes and the way you crossed your t s
now he s asking to be your friend albeit a decade or two later via the world wide web
curious you accept his request you just wan na know if he ended up marrying missy the homecoming queen or if he finally made it to hollywood
after seeing that he did indeed make missy his missus lrb with whom he reared four hideous mulleted children rrb and that he did indeed take off to tinseltown lrb you thought that dude in that scary skinemax flick looked familiar rrb you feel no desire to maintain ties with the former bully
well friend this is your chance to get back at old biff so unfriend away
in fact num percent of those surveyed would pull rather pull the trigger on an old foe than anyone else on facebook
revenge is a dish best served cold and nothing s colder than depriving someone of your thoroughly illuminating status updates there s an emo song lyric for every occasion right one last thing our survey also included the option of exboss but only num percent of respondents would unfriend that acquaintance over all others
good thinking you really should not be friends with your boss on facebook anyway
new delhi lrb cnn rrb indians want their version of the american dream
even the chinese dream will do
and so they have voted for a man who promises more for less more development and growth with less government and red tape
for india s num billion dreamers their new prime minister narendra modi is a known commodity
his simple mandate is to do for india what he has done for the north western state of gujarat in the last num years conjure up chineselevels of growth and prosperity
but for modi s counterparts in washington beijing and islamabad india s new leader is considered a wildcard
will he be aggressive or a dove what is his foreign policy does he have a vision for india s place in the world there s very little to go on
modi has never addressed foreign policy at length indian campaigns rarely involve debates on world affairs
few in new delhi seem to have a clear sense of his plans
when i spoke with arun shourie a former indian minister now being touted as a top candidate to head the finance ministry i got a telling response anyone who says they know modi s plans does not really know anything
the ones who know wo not talk
so let s start with the few signals we ve received from the man himself
reaching out to neighbors modi has certainly begun with a flourish scoring a coup in getting his pakistani counterpart to attend his swearingin
on monday nawaz sharif became the first pakistani prime minister in history to attend an indian prime minister s inauguration
the two men were photographed exchanging a firm handshake
modi later tweeted that sharif had shared some very emotional things during their meeting
he elaborated with a story about how sharif s mother became emotional when watching modi s mother offering him sweets
lrb read the series of tweets here rrb modi s twitter account also highlights his early attempts to strengthen ties with his new counterparts
after his election he announced to his num million followers congratulatory messages from us president barack obama israel s pm netanyahu german chancellor angela merkel france s hollande russia s putin as well as leaders from new zealand fiji qatar afghanistan and more
japan got an especially lavish mention personally i have a wonderful experience of working with japan as lsb chief minister of gujarat
rsb modi tweeted
i am sure we will take indiajapan ties to newer heights
japan s pm shinzo abe follows only three people on twitter modi of course is one of them
twitter diplomacy is not just about rhetoric there have been some early results too
sri lankan president mahinda rajapakse tweeted sunday as a goodwill measure on the occasion of narendramodi s swearingin president instructs officials to release indian fishermen in custody
none of the above sheds light on what kind of vision modi has but it is indeed a refreshing marker of proactive engagement the opposite of india s foreign policy in years gone by
in an excellent essay in foreign affairs last month manjari chatterjee miller described how indian foreign policy in the last num years has been characterized more by continuity than by change irrespective of the party in power
nonalignment india s relations with major powers have stayed stable
broadly there are two reasons behind this trend
one is india s historic pledge of nonalignment the country s first prime minister jawaharlal nehru founded the global nonaligned movement a group of states agreeing to not align with major powers
the other reason is india s neglect of foreign policy planning from the very top civil servants get littletono instruction from the prime minister s office and so have great levels of autonomy and wield significant power
the result is no clear vision from new delhi and a general stasis in india s relations with the world
it has often been pointed out that india has fewer diplomats than singapore a country with a population numth the size of india s
india has consistently punched below its weight despite aspiring to be a global player
will modi change these trends again it is difficult to read his mind
but turn again to what modi has actually said
the writer dhruva jaishanker points out that modi has repeatedly stated that foreign policy begins at home
this is not to suggest that modi will be insular
instead his relations with other countries will be driven by business needs and a sense of realism perhaps similar in theory to china s relations with south asian and african states
many writers and commentators have expressed fears about modi s foreign policy on two main fronts
first that he will channel his brand of prohindu nationalism into friction with pakistan
second that he will use his prior history with washington modi s us visa was revoked in num over a neverbeforeused religious freedoms act as a reason to snub the world s biggest economy
on both fronts we have no way of confirming those fears just yet
but with each passing day we are witnessing an evolving modi a realist whose goal is to grow india inc and do business with anyone at home or abroad who can help achieve that goal
modi s real test will be whether he can bring a longerterm vision to india s foreign policy planning
will he keep new delhi nonaligned will he pivot further east will he help fulfil obama s prediction that india and the us will form the numst century s defining partnership only modi knows the answers
but if indian foreign policy has so far not been driven by the prime minister s office i think we can now expect that strange quirk to change
for better or worse prime minister modi will take charge
lrb cnn rrb on a cold december evening the green and white of celtic were demolishing the red and gold of motherwell and extending their lead at the top of scotland s premier league
at the same time a few hundred of their fans were demolishing seats throwing green smoke bombs onto the pitch and extending their reputation for notoriety
for celtic s management it was the final straw
they banned num celtic supporters from attending future home matches and coach neil lennon bemoaned the powder keg atmosphere generated by a group of fanatical followers called the green brigade
there are passionate soccer supporters the world over the sort who name sons after their clubs stars or travel hundreds of miles on a wet tuesday evening
but celtic s green brigade brings a sectarian flavor to its support for glasgow s catholic club
in fact it s more than a flavor though its members have described themselves as antisectarian
this week celtic went before the disciplinary committee of european football s governing body uefa for the seventh time in as many years
the latest infraction the green brigade had unfolded huge pictures of a scottish nationalist hero william wallace and more controversially of irish republican army hungerstriker bobby sands before a recent game against ac milan
above the portraits the slogan the terrorist or the dreamer
uefa punishes such behavior particularly messages that are of a political ideological religious offensive or provocative nature
it holds clubs responsible for the actions of its fans whether signs chanting or throwing pyrotechnics
celtic was fined num euros and responded by asking all its fans to unite with the club with no more such banners
celtic is one half of the most famous and at times infamous rivalry in british football
its old enemy glasgow rangers has protestant affiliations and for many years had a policy of not buying catholic players
submerged in debt rangers fell on hard times
now the club resurrected as a new company but still featuring its predecessor s team manager and several of its players is in the lower reaches of the scottish league
but in the past the two glasgow clubs epic battles for supremacy have been accompanied by provocative anthems sectarian songs violence and even deaths among supporters
there was a time when a club s directors would see such behavior as part of the fans identity with a cause or heritage
football in europe grew up in the slums of industrialized cities generations before the term politically correct was born
glasgow celtic was founded to provide charity to irish catholics who had fled famine for work in scotland
and religious identity was a mooring in an alien land
similarly in liverpool where one in four inhabitants in the late numth century was of irish origin everton fc was run by liberals supporting home rule for ireland while liverpool fc was dominated by protestant and unionist figures
today club football is big business with sponsors paying millions to have their names on stadiums and shirts and top players earning six figures a week
consultancy deloitte calculates that the num richest clubs lrb all in europe rrb generated more than num billion in revenues in num
a club like celtic which competes in the european champions league wants to attract international stars regardless of how or whether they were baptized
getting into constant trouble with the european football authorities does not help
the fines are minimal it s the damage to reputation that puts off sponsors
after the bobby sands incident celtic s chief executive peter lawwell reminded fans that celtic was a top football club in fantastic shape aiming to play its part as a major football club on the european stage
but fans do not always want to cooperate with the new corporate branding that clubs like to project
for sure those attached to sectarian labels are a very small minority
the rest of society has moved on and religious observance has shrunk
but traditions and rivalries are ingrained for literally millions of fans in the uk and around the world
supporters of english premier league side hull city have launched a vocal campaign against plans by the owner to change the club s name to hull tigers to broaden its appeal in asia
the name of the protest group city till we die is a mark of the emotions generated
similarly cardiff city fans last year protested the decision of malaysian owner vincent tan to change the team s colors from blue to lucky red
many fans just do not trust the corporate ownership of their clubs
in july the new director of fan relationship management at manchester city made the mistake of saying his mission was to better engage them serve them and monetize them
beyond britain regional political and class differences or the memory of them still feed the rivalries and passions of football fans
in milan both ac and internazionale have their own versions of the green brigade known as ultras
ac supporters tend to be more working class inter s from more affluent parts of the city
several italian clubs inter among them have been in trouble because of a neonazi fringe of supporters
the rome club lazio which was the favorite of italian dictator benito mussolini has a notorious group of rightwing irreducibili ultras among its fans
in the past they have even taunted jewish supporters of rivals as roma with posters recalling the holocaust
history also infuses spain s greatest rivalry between barcelona and real madrid
barca is the champion of the catalans traditionally a more leftwing club than real representative of the capital s elite
these passions still have a feverish hold
but a new era of multimillion dollar sponsorship and television deals stadia with executive boxes behind smoked glass and the spiraling price of match tickets has changed the game
consultants price waterhouse said in a recent report all sporting bodies are walking a tightrope as they attempt to balance increased commercial demands on their sports with the often conflicting need to maintain the integrity and unpredictability that make sporting competitions so exciting and appealing to their supporters
one example barcelona s firstever deal with a sponsor in num a fiveyear contract with the qatar foundation lrb later qatar airways rrb worth more than num million
fans began a petition against the commercialization of their beloved team and one of its most famous former players johann cruyff described the deal as vulgar
but the sponsorship remained
fans lrb and some players rrb also grumble at the need for their teams to go on tiring preseason tours of north america or the far east to open up new markets for their club s brand
the big football clubs with monstrous wage bills could not survive without sponsorship and television deals whose value is growing faster than revenue from tickets
but the fans are still the fabric of any club
in the era of social media they are able to organize and protest and more are doing just that
lrb cnn rrb people sometimes have difficulty understanding why the families of those who die in disasters are so invested in the recovery of their loved ones bodies
this painful process has been once again brought into sharp relief by the difficulty of retrieving the bodies of those lost in the downing of malaysia airlines flight num from ukrainian rebels who control the crash site
the international committee of the red cross notes that international humanitarian law requires combatants to respect the bodies of those who die in conflict reflecting the importance people attach to the bodies of their loved ones
throughout history most cultures have emphasized the management of the bodies of the deceased
indeed cultures around the world lrb and religions are a part of one s culture rrb still observe different important traditions for what happens with human remains most commonly ranging from burial to various forms of cremation
grieving families often are eager to perform their traditional rituals for the remains of their loved ones a process that can bring some level of comfort
but in the early stages of mass casualty disasters families often share the experience of grief with other families whose loved ones have died sometimes joining together in a family assistance center to await news of their loved ones and the identification of the remains
after day of tributes more remains of victims to arrive in netherlands it is when the remains of their loved ones are returned to the family that the more personal experience of the death tends to begin
families will generally leave the family assistance center and return to their homes to grieve with their extended families and friends
while many funerary rituals can be performed without a body knowing the exact disposition of the loved ones remains is often a crucial comfort to the family
the death of a loved one can of course be devastating even if that person is the only one to die in an incident
but disaster mental health professionals know that mass casualty disasters are much more difficult for families than disasters in which only a few people die
it is not clear why but the old adage that misery loves company does not seem to apply to mass casualty disasters
as stressful as mass casualty incidents are however responders generally know to expect an even more stressful disaster if it is an incident in which body recovery is likely to be very difficult or even impossible
the recent disappearance of malaysia airlines flight num is a classic example
without knowing even the location of the downed aircraft the recovery of the remains of the passengers and crew becomes more unlikely with each passing day
this is likely to complicate the grieving process for the survivors
traditional cultural rituals for the dead help us to process grief in a meaningful way
grief is not magically resolved through these rituals but it is one step in the process of building a new life without the presence of the loved one
what happens to the victims bodies next the emphasis on the return of the bodies of loved ones to their families is also reflected in the efforts of government officials
many times rescue and recovery personnel place their own lives at risk as they try to return bodies
underwater recoveries such as the crash of flight num in num for example present extreme challenges to the recovery teams
similarly in the aftermath of the attacks of september num thousands of personnel worked in difficult and dangerous efforts to recover the remains of those who died
some who worked in these recovery efforts have told me that the work was extremely dangerous but that it was worth it to help the families as they grieved
similarly personnel working in mass casualty morgues have often asked me to tell the families of the deceased how respectfully the remains of their loved ones were treated
within mainstream american culture people often seem uncomfortable with the grieving process
individuals coping with the death of a loved one are often told to get over it or move on
but even in ideal situations the grieving process may continue for a year or more in healthy individuals and periods of grief may continue to occur for years
some moment may trigger a memory of the loved one who died and lead to a reawakening of the grief
this is not a sign of psychopathology but of being human
the most helpful process in dealing with grief seems to be talking with family friends and spiritual leaders
it is also useful to understand that you do not have to be mentally ill to seek support from a mental health professional
this may be particularly useful if family and friends do not seem to understand or appreciate the grief one is experiencing
lrb cnn rrb a glorious attacking display by athletic bilbao earned the spanish side a num win at schalke in the first leg of the europa league quarterfinals at the veltins arena on thursday
fernando llorente put athletic ahead in the numth minute poking the ball home after a schalke goalkeeper timo hildebrand mishandled the ball
but the lead did not last long with spain s raul latching onto a cross from japan defender atsuto uchida to level the scores two minutes later
